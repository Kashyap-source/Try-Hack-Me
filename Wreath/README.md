 **Task 1: Introduction**
 
Wreath is designed as a learning resource for beginners with a primary focus on:

- Pivoting
- Working with the Empire C2 (Command and Control) framework
- Simple Anti-Virus evasion techniques

The following topics will also be covered, albeit more briefly:

- Code Analysis (Python and PHP)
- Locating and modifying public exploits
- Simple webapp enumeration and exploitation
- Git Repository Analysis
- Simple Windows Post-Exploitation techniques
- CLI Firewall Administration (CentOS and Windows)
- Cross-Compilation techniques
- Coding wrapper programs
- Simple exfiltration techniques
- Formatting a pentest report

These will be taught in the course of exploiting the Wreath network.

This is designed as almost a sandbox environment to follow along with the teaching content; the focus will be on the above teaching points, rather than on initial access and privilege escalation exploits (contrary to other boxes on the platform where the focus is on the challenge).
 
 ***Prerequisites:***
 This network is designed for beginners, but assumes basic competence in the Linux command line and fundamental hacking methodology. The ability to read and write a little code will also be useful. Any other required knowledge will be linked throughout the tasks.
 
 
 ***Task 2: Accessing the Network***
 
 ***Controlling the Network:***

The network has three states: Running, Stopped, and Resetting.

The current state can be shown at the top right of the network box at the top of the page:
